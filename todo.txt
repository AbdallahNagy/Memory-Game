//////////////////////////
draft:
how to only select 2 imgs randomly

-another solution is to store them in 12 length array
and pop the chosen one

-make copy of the array
-random url from the array, store it in the actual image,
-and then pop it out.
-repeat

Qns
const arrays can change it???
->const array is a const reference,
it doesn't define a const array
